# L2Vista-api-server
In the expansive world of cross-chain protocols, L2Vista-api-server stands out as a pivotal solution. This isn't just an APIâ€”it's our answer to the fragmented web of Ethereum's layer2 transactions, weaving them into a unified narrative.

## Introduction
Navigating the myriad of cross-chain transactions can be daunting. Enter L2Vista: a unified platform distilling transactions from notable chains like Optimism, Base, Zora, and Mode. With support from The-Graph and Covalent, our API server specializes in tracking cross-chain protocols, including Hyperlane and Chainlink CCIP, with unparalleled accuracy.

## API Endpoints
### Transaction History API
Fetch the intricacies of every transaction:
```
/tx?amount=5&skip=0&tochain=420&hash=0xa82c95ceb3a44b5a2bf752af8f066c9a2a4a908860c98f3514161be596260d2d
```

- Dive deeper with optional parameters like `formchain`, `tochain`, and `hash`.

### Transaction Count API
Quantifying the myriad transactions:
```
/tx?amount=5&skip=0&fromchain=999&tochain=420
```
- Optional parameters: `formchain`, `tochain`, and `hash`.
